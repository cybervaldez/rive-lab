# Technologies

Research artifacts for technologies used in this project.

Run `/research {tech}` to research a technology and create reference docs for skills.

**Note:** Research happens here in your project, not in the playbook source. This ensures research has real project context (file structure, conventions, existing techs) for deterministic, useful reference docs.
